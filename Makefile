#
# A simple and stupid Makefile for python-efl.
#
# This is mainly targeted at lazy devlopers (like me) that
# want to type less or do not want to learn the python
# setup syntax.
#
# NOTE: This file is also used to discriminate when we are building from
# stable tarballs (in this case we disable cython by default) or from git
# sources as the Makefile is not distributed.
#
# Usage:
#
# make <cmd>            to build using the default python interpreter
# make <cmd> PY=pythonX to build using the specified python interpreter
#
