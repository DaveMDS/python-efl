Style
=====

* For indentation, use *four space characters* per level of indentation. Keep
  lines under the 80 chars limit (only exception are the functions definition)

* When comparing C pointers with NULL, use == and != instead of the python
  operator "is". This makes a visual distinction between python and C code.

* For long lines that do not fit in the 80 cols please use only the first
  raccomandation from PEP-8 (Aligned with opening delimiter). Example:
  Yes:
    foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                             var_three, var_four)
  No:
    foo = long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two,
        var_three, var_four)

  This to keep new code consistent with the rest of the bindings and to
  try to match the style of the C efl code style as much as possible.
  ...also because I found it more readable and I like it more :P -davemds-

  :ref:`Elm_List_Mode` (for enums)

  :func:`efl.evas.Object.delete`  (for items not in current scope)
  :func:`~efl.evas.Object.delete` (will show it short, just "delete")

  ``ELM_LIST_SCROLL``  (for enum values, bools and None)


* Versions:

.. versionadded:: 1.15

.. versionchanged:: 1.15
    Description of the change.

.. deprecated:: 1.15
    Use the blah, blah way instead.

* Notes:

    .. seealso:: :py:attr:`mode`

    .. note:: Some text to be noted, blah, blah, blah,
        some more information for this note, etc.

    .. warning:: Same as note, but the box will be red
        some more information for this warning, etc.


Design patterns
===============

 * From "The Zen of Python":

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!


Tips
====

* cython does automatic dict <-> struct conversion with basic struct members


Release process instructions
============================

* Announce at enlightenment-release@lists.sourceforge.net and
  enlightenment-devel@lists.sourceforge.net that you are planning for the release
* Change versions in efl/__init__.py (ex: 1.9.0)
* Update the ChangeLog file:
    setup.py build_doc -b changes ...and manually merge from the html file
* Git push and wait jenkins to generate the 2 tarballs
* Test the generated tarballs
* scp tarballs & md5sums to:
  download.enlightenment.org:/srv/web/download.enlightenment.org/public_html/pre-releases/
* Announce at enlightenment-release@lists.sourceforge.net and
  enlightenment-devel@lists.sourceforge.net that tarballs are ready for testing

... wait 24 hours, fix any issues found. In the mean time you can prepare the
    release announcement for phame/ml.

* ssh to download.enlightenment.org and mv tarballs & md5sums to:
    /srv/web/download.enlightenment.org/public_html/rel/bindings/python/
* Upload the .tar.gz archive to pypi:
   - first upload the PKG-INFO file from the "edit" section on pypi
   - then upload the tarball from the "files" section
* Create and push the tag for the release
    git tag -a v1.9.0 && git push origin v1.9.0
* Create and push the branch for stable backporting
    git branch python-efl-1.9 && git push origin python-efl-1.9
* scp the generated html documentation to:
  download.enlightenment.org:/srv/web/docs.enlightenment.org/public_html/python-efl/1.XX.0/
  and update the 'current' link on the server (ssh)
* Update download link on the wiki (www.enlightenment.org/download)
* Publish the blog post on phame (Official Announcements)
* Announce the release to release@lists.enlightenment.org
* Change versions again in efl/__init__.py (ex: 1.9.99)

Discussion
==========

* Internal utility functions used in the bindings must start with an
  underscore and must have the shortest name as possible.
  ^
  This needs further discussion/expansion.

  When we define a function with cdef it is not exposed to Python API.
  This should be explicit enough to not need the underscore prefix, which
  at best looks ugly, and at worst just plain confusing.

  A function name should summarize its functionality in one clear text,
  short sentence. We have both too long and too short names. And I admit to
  being guilty of adding many of both.

  Let's build up a short review so we can see where we stand with this and
  make necessary corrections.

  The underscore usage is a coding standard in all the EFL, we should try
  to follow the efl style also here (where is possible and make sense)
