Widget description
------------------

.. image:: /images/image-preview.png


An Elementary image object allows one to load and display an image
file on it, be it from a disk file or from a memory region.

Exceptionally, one may also load an Edje group as the contents of the
image. In this case, though, most of the functions of the image API will
act as a no-op.

One can tune various properties of the image, like:

- pre-scaling,
- smooth scaling,
- orientation,
- aspect ratio during resizes, etc.

An image object may also be made valid source and destination for drag
and drop actions by setting :py:attr:`~Image.editable`.

Signals that you can add callbacks for are:

- ``"drop"`` - This is called when a user has dropped an image
    typed object onto the object in question -- the
    event info argument is the path to that image file
- ``"clicked"`` - This is called when a user has clicked the image
- ``"download,start"`` - remote url download has started
- ``"download,progress"`` - url download in progress
- ``"download,end"`` - remote url download has finished
- ``"download,error"`` - remote url download has finished with errors
