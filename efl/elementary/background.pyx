Widget description
------------------

The background widget is used for setting a solid color, image or Edje group
as a background to a window or any container object.

The background widget is used for setting (solid) background decorations
to a window (unless it has transparency enabled) or to any container
object. It works just like an image, but has some properties useful to a
background, like setting it to tiled, centered, scaled or stretched.


Default content parts of the bg widget that you can use for are:

- ``overlay`` - overlay of the bg
