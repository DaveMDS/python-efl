Widget description
------------------

This widget holds two content :py:class:`efl.evas.Object`: one on
the front and one on the back. It allows you to flip from front to back
and vice-versa using various animations.

If either the front or back contents are not set the flip will treat that
as transparent. So if you were to set the front content but not the back,
and then call :py:meth:`Flip.go` you would see whatever is below the flip.

For a list of supported animations see :py:meth:`Flip.go`.

Signals that you can add callbacks for are:

- ``animate,begin`` - when a flip animation was started
- ``animate,done`` - when a flip animation is finished

Default content parts of the flip widget that you can use for are:

- ``front`` - A front content of the flip
- ``back`` - A back content of the flip
