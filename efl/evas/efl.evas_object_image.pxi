    Image from file or buffer.

    .. rubric:: Introduction

    Image will consider the object's :py:attr:`geometry`
    as the area to paint with tiles as described by :py:attr:`fill` and the
    real pixels (image data) will be stored as described by
    :py:attr:`image_size`. This can be tricky to understand at
    first, but gives flexibility to do everything.

    If an image is loaded from file, it will have
    :py:attr:`image_size` set to its original size, unless some
    other size was set with :py:attr:`load_size`, :py:attr:`load_dpi` or
    :py:attr:`load_scale_down`.

    Pixels will be scaled to match size specified by :py:attr:`fill` using
    either sampled or smooth methods, these can be specified with
    :py:attr:`smooth_scale`. The scale will consider borders as specified by
    :py:attr:`border` and :py:attr:`border_center_fill`, while the former
    specify the border dimensions (top and bottom will scale horizontally, while
    right and left will do vertically, corners are kept unscaled), the latter
    says whenever the center of the image will be used (useful to create
    frames).

    Contents will be tiled using :py:attr:`fill` information in order to paint
    :py:attr:`~efl.evas.Object.geometry`, so if you want an image to be drawn
    just once, you should match every :py:attr:`geometry` = **x, y, w, h** by a
    call to :py:attr:`fill` = **0, 0, w, h**. :py:class:`FilledImage` does that
    for you.

    .. rubric:: Pixel data and buffer API

    Images implement the Python Buffer API, so it's possible to use it
    where buffers are expected (ie: file.write()). Available data will
    depend on :py:attr:`alpha`, :py:attr:`colorspace` and
    :py:attr:`image_size`, lines should be considered multiple
    of :py:attr:`stride`, with the following considerations about
    colorspace:

    - **EVAS_COLORSPACE_ARGB8888:** This pixel format is a linear block of
        pixels, starting at the top-left row by row until the bottom right of
        the image or pixel region. All pixels are 32-bit unsigned int's with
        the high-byte being alpha and the low byte being blue in the format
        ARGB. Alpha may or may not be used by evas depending on the alpha flag
        of the image, but if not used, should be set to 0xff anyway.
        This colorspace uses premultiplied alpha. That means that R, G and B
        cannot exceed A in value. The conversion from non-premultiplied
        colorspace is::

            R = (r * a) / 255; G = (g * a) / 255; B = (b * a) / 255;

        So 50% transparent blue will be: 0x80000080. This will not be "dark" -
        just 50% transparent. Values are 0 == black, 255 == solid or full
        red, green or blue.

    .. **EVAS_COLORSPACE_RGB565_A5P:** In the process of being implemented in
        1 engine only. This may change. This is a pointer to image data for
        16-bit half-word pixel data in 16bpp RGB 565 format (5 bits red,
        6 bits green, 5 bits blue), with the high-byte containing red and the
        low byte containing blue, per pixel. This data is packed row by row
        from the top-left to the bottom right. If the image has an alpha
        channel enabled there will be an extra alpha plane **after** the color
        pixel plane. If not, then this data will not exist and should not be
        accessed in any way. This plane is a set of pixels with 1 byte per
        pixel defining the alpha values of all pixels in the image from
        the top-left to the bottom right of the image, row by row. Even though
        the values of the alpha pixels can be 0 to 255, only values 0 through
        to 31 are used, 31 being solid and 0 being transparent.
        RGB values can be 0 to 31 for red and blue and 0 to 63 for green, with 0
        being black and 31 or 63 being full red, green or blue respectively.
        This colorspace is also pre-multiplied like EVAS_COLORSPACE_ARGB8888 so::

            R = (r * a) / 32; G = (g * a) / 32; B = (b * a) / 32;

    .. note:: if an image is resized it will **tile** it's contents respecting
        geometry set by :py:attr:`fill`, so if you want the contents to be
        **scaled** you need to call :py:attr:`fill` with ``x=0, y=0, w=new_width,
        h=new_height``, or you should use :py:class:`FilledImage` instead.
