BUGS
====
* EdjeEdit: PartState API does not work
* Elm.Map: overlays_show segfaults, scrollers in examples are jumpy

Failing unit tests
------------------
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testPartEffect (marked as known failure)
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testGroupDel (skipped, segfault)
* tests.edje.test_04_edit: testExternal (skipped, TODO)

TODO (after 1.8)
================
* update links and text on:
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
  (requires fd.org shell account?)
* Review the internal functions and name them consistently
* Evas: SmartObject needs testing, work. Make it inheritable by extension
  classes?
* Elm unit tests, things like top_widget and getting child objects
  can be done easily.
* include python-ethumb
* edje: complete the unit tests
* Initial Evas GL support (for Elm)
* Add more documentation for callbacks, events, etc.
* Check for missing Eo type mappings
