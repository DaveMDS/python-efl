        A simple class to perform asynchronous DNS lookups.

        :param string name: The hostname to query
        :param callable done_cb: The function to call when done
        :param \*args: Any other arguments will be passed back in ``done_cb``
        :param \**kargs: Any other keywords arguments will be passed back in ``done_cb``

        .. versionadded:: 1.17

        Just create an instance and give a callback function to be called
        when the operation is complete.

        This class performs a DNS lookup on the hostname specified by
        `name`, then calls `done_cb` with the result and the data given as
        parameter. The result will be given to the done_cb as follows:

        **expected `done_cb` signature**::

            func(canonname, ip, sockaddr)

        where:
            * **canonname** (string) is the canonical domain name
            * **ip** (string) is the recolved ip address
            * **sockaddr** (None) is a placeholder for future expansion



        **Usage example**::

            import ecore_con

            def done_cb(canonname, ip, sockaddr):
                print(canonname)
                print(ip)

            ecore_con.Lookup('example.com', done_cb)

        
        """

        if not callable(done_cb):
            raise TypeError("Parameter 'done_cb' must be callable")

        self.done_cb = done_cb
        self.args = args
        self.kargs = kargs

        if isinstance(name, unicode): name = PyUnicode_AsUTF8String(name)
        ecore_con_lookup(<const char *>name if name is not None else NULL,
                         _con_dns_lookup_cb, <void*>self)

        Py_INCREF(self)
