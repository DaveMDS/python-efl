    Utility class to make it easy to perform http requests (POST, GET, etc).

    .. versionadded:: 1.17

    Brief usage:
        1. Create an :class:`Url` object with ecore_con.Url('myurl')
        2. Register object callbacks using :func:`on_complete_event_add`,
           :func:`on_progress_event_add` and :func:`on_data_event_add` to
           receive the response, e.g. for HTTP/FTP downloads.
        3. Perform the operation with :func:`get`, :func:`head` and :func:`post`

    If it's necessary use the :attr:`url` property. to change the object url. 

    .. note::
        It is good practice to reuse :class:`Url` objects wherever possible,
        but bear in mind that each one can only perform one operation at a
        time. You need to wait for the complete event before re-using or
        destroying the object.

    .. warning::
        It is **really important** to call the :func:`delete()` method as soon
        as you have finished with your object, as it automatically remove all
        the registered events for you, that will otherwise continue to use
        resources.

    Basic usage examples::

        # HTTP GET
        u = ecore.Url("http://www.google.com")
        u.get()

        # HTTP POST
        u = ecore.Url('https://httpbin.org/post')
        u.post(b'my data to post', 'text/txt')

        # FTP download
        u = ecore.Url("ftp://ftp.example.com/pub/myfile")
        u.get()

        # FTP upload as ftp://ftp.example.com/file
        u = ecore.Url("ftp://ftp.example.com")
        u.ftp_upload("/tmp/file", "user", "pass", None)

        # FTP upload as ftp://ftp.example.com/dir/file
        u = ecore.Url("ftp://ftp.example.com")
        u.ftp_upload("/tmp/file", "user", "pass", "dir")

    To actually make something usefull with your request you will need to
    connect the :class:`EventUrlComplete`, :class:`EventUrlProgress` and
    :class:`EventUrlData` events using the :func:`on_complete_event_add` and
    friends functions.

    A more complete example::

        from efl import ecore

        def on_data(event):
            print("data: " + str(event.data[:80]))
            # do something here with the received data

        def on_progress(event):
            # print(event)
            print("received %d on a total of %d bytes" % (
                   event.down_now, event.down_total))

        def on_complete(event):
            # print(event)
            print("http result: %d" % event.status)
            print("Total received bytes: %d" % event.url.received_bytes)

            u.delete() # don't forget to delete !!

        u = ecore.Url('http://www.google.com', verbose=False)
        u.on_data_event_add(on_data)
        u.on_progress_event_add(on_progress)
        u.on_complete_event_add(on_complete)
        u.get()

        ecore.main_loop_begin()

    If you need  to save the received data to a file use the :attr:`fd`
    property, as::

        fd = open('/tmp/tmpMxBtta', 'w')
        u = ecore.Url('http://example.com', fd=fd.fileno())
        u.get()

    .. seealso::
        If you just need to download a file please consider using the
        simpler :class:`efl.ecore.FileDownload` class instead.

    .. seealso::
        The ecore module level functions :func:`url_pipeline_set` and
        :func:`url_pipeline_get` to enable HTTP 1.1 pipelining.
