cdef class Poller(Eo):
    """

    Ecore poller provides infrastructure for the creation of pollers. Pollers
    are, in essence, callbacks that share a single timer per type. Because not
    all pollers need to be called at the same frequency the user may specify the
    frequency in ticks(each expiration of the shared timer is called a tick, in
    ecore poller parlance) for each added poller. Ecore pollers should only be
    used when the poller doesn't have specific requirements on the exact times
    to poll.

    This architecture means that the main loop is only woken up once to handle
    all pollers of that type, this will save power as the CPU has more of a
    chance to go into a low power state the longer it is asleep for, so this
    should be used in situations where power usage is a concern.

    For now only 1 core poller type is supported: ECORE_POLLER_CORE, the default
    interval for ECORE_POLLER_CORE is 0.125(or 1/8th) second.

    The `interval` must be between 1 and 32768 inclusive, and must be a power of
    2 (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... 16384, 32768). The exact tick in which `func`
    will be called is undefined, as only the interval between calls can be
    defined. Ecore will endeavor to keep pollers synchronized and to call as
    many in 1 wakeup event as possible. If `interval` is not a power of two, the
    closest power of 2 greater than `interval` will be used.

    When the poller `func` is called, it must return a value of either
    ECORE_CALLBACK_RENEW(or True) or ECORE_CALLBACK_CANCEL(or False). If it
    returns 1, it will be called again at the next tick, or if it returns
    0 it will be deleted automatically making any references/handles for it
    invalid.

    Example::

        def poller_cb():
            print("Poller")
            return True

        ecore.Poller(4, poller_cb)
