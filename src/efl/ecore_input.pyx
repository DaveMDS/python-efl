:mod:`efl.ecore_input` Module
#############################

.. versionadded:: 1.17

This module provide access to the low-level input events, you usually
don't need to use this stuff, unless you need some sort of custom event
handling.

To be informed about specific events just use one of the
on_*_add(func, \*args, \**kargs) functions, the callback given will be fired
when events occur.

Callback signature is::

    func(event, *args, **kargs) â†’ int

Where ``event`` will be a class relative to the specific event (such as
:class:`EventKey`) All the additional arguments and keyword arguments passed
in the \*_add function will be passed back in the callback.

In some events (EventKey at least) the callback function may return
ecore.ECORE_CALLBACK_DONE or ecore.ECORE_CALLBACK_PASS_ON to block the
event propagation down the chain or not.

To stop receiving event use :func:`efl.ecore.EventHandler.delete`
