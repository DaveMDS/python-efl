        """The datetime format. Format is a combination of allowed Libc date format
        specifiers like: "%b %d, %Y %I : %M %p".

        Maximum allowed format length is 64 chars.

        Format can include separators for each individual datetime field except
        for AM/PM field.

        Each separator can be a maximum of 6 UTF-8 bytes.
        Space is also taken as a separator.

        Following are the allowed set of format specifiers for each datetime field.

        **%%Y** The year as a decimal number including the century.

        **%%y** The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).

        **%%m** The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).

        **%%b** The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.

        **%%B** The full month name according to the current locale.

        **%%h** The abbreviated month name according to the current locale(same as %%b).

        **%%d** The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).

        **%%e** The day of the month as a decimal number (range 1 to 31). single
                digits are preceded by a blank.

        **%%I** The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).

        **%%H** The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).

        **%%k** The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23). single
                digits are preceded by a blank.

        **%%l** The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12); single
                digits are preceded by a blank.

        **%%M** The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).

        **%%p** Either 'AM' or 'PM' according to the given time value, or the
                corresponding strings for the current locale. Noon is treated as 'PM'
                and midnight as 'AM'.

        **%%P** Like %p but in lower case: 'am' or 'pm' or a corresponding string for
                the current locale.

        **%%c** The preferred date and time representation for the current locale.

        **%%x** The preferred date representation for the current locale without the time.

        **%%X** The preferred time representation for the current locale without the date.

        **%%r** The complete calendar time using the AM/PM format of the current locale.

        **%%R** The hour and minute in decimal numbers using the format %H:%M.

        **%%T** The time of day in decimal numbers using the format %H:%M:%S.

        **%%D** The date using the format %%m/%%d/%%y.

        **%%F** The date using the format %%Y-%%m-%%d.

        These specifiers can be arranged in any order and the widget will display the
        fields accordingly.

        Default format is taken as per the system locale settings.
